# New York Times Dashboard

This is a flask app that visualizes a set of data including all articles by New York Times published this month. Data is visualized using Plotly.
This is a project in development for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Prerequisites

To install the flask app, you need:
- python3
- python packages in the requirements.txt file

 Install the packages with
```
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installing

On a MacOS/linux system, installation is easy. Open a terminal, and go into
the directory with the flask app files. Run `python nytdashboard.py` in the terminal.

## Agenda

1. The overwhelming flood of information
2. A possible support
3.  


### Advantages of using VADER
- VADER has a lot of advantages over traditional methods of Sentiment Analysis, including:
- It works exceedingly well on social media type text, yet readily generalizes to multiple domains
- It doesnâ€™t require any training data but is constructed from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon
- It is fast enough to be used online with streaming data, and
- It does not severely suffer from a speed-performance tradeoff.
