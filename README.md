This is a flask app that visualizes a set of data including all articles by New York Times published this month. Data is visualized using Plotly.
This is a project in development for the Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree.

## Agenda

1. The flood of information
2. Perspectives on a solution
3. Development of a New York Times dashboard
4. Limitations and possible improvements
5. How to install it yourself

### Advantages of using VADER
- VADER has a lot of advantages over traditional methods of Sentiment Analysis, including:
- It works exceedingly well on social media type text, yet readily generalizes to multiple domains
- It doesnâ€™t require any training data but is constructed from a generalizable, valence-based, human-curated gold standard sentiment lexicon
- It is fast enough to be used online with streaming data, and
- It does not severely suffer from a speed-performance tradeoff.
